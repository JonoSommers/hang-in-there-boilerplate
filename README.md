# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
    - I built an application that allows a user to cycle through randomly generated motivated posters. Each poster has an image, a title, and a quote and the user has the ability to create their own poster as well. Users can save posters that they like, or posters that they created, and there is an additional Unmotivational Posters section that shows (what I find humurous) negative posters. If the user does not like the unmotivational posters they have the ability to delete them from the section by double clicking anywhere on the poster (including the background). This application was built to help encourage those who need a pick-me-up, or a quick laugh (from reading the unmotivational posters). The hope is that there is at least one poster that the user can relate to, or is impacted postiviely by, that can help brigthen their mood or encourage them to keep pushing forward.
