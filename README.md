# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
    - I built an application that allows a user to cycle through randomly generated motivated posters. Each poster has an image, a title, and a quote and the user has the ability to create their own poster as well. Users can save posters that they like, or posters that they created, and there is an additional Unmotivational Posters section that shows (what I find humorous) negative posters. If the user does not like the unmotivational posters they have the ability to delete them from the section by double clicking anywhere on the poster (including the background). This application was built to help encourage those who need a pick-me-up, or a quick laugh (from reading the unmotivational posters). The hope is that there is at least one poster that the user can relate to, or is impacted positively by, that can help brighten their mood or encourage them to keep pushing forward.  

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
    - They first need to head to Github and search my name 'Jono Sommers', click on users, and find my profile.
    - The next step would be to head to my repositories, fork my hang-in-there-boilerplate repository, copy the SSH code after they forked it, and run 'git clone (paste SSH code)' in their terminal.
    - After that they need to navigate to the directory the cloned down the repo, right click on the index.html file, and select 'open with live server' (or another option if they don't have live server).

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
    - It took me nearly the entire allotted time to complete this project. I did a lot of research to understand any topics that were confusing to me and I learned quite a bit throughout this entire process. 
    - I am currently in Mod 2, and 7.5 weeks into my Turing journey (about 12.5 weeks counting Mod 0 and the intermissions).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
    - The learning goals were:
        - Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
        - Write clean, DRY JavaScript
            - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
            - Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
            - Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
        - Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

    - Tech I worked with:
        - HTML
        - JavaScript
        - CSS
        - VS Code


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
    - Wins:
        - Learned a lot of new methods and properties that can help in future projects such as:
            - .closest()
            - .replaceChildren()
            - event.target
        - Built a better understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and how they work together. This was a big win for me because I was very confused about this when I first started the project.
        - Completing my first FE project was a big win in itself. My confidence in myself and my programming knowledge has grown significantly throughout this project.
